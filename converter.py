def convert_awd_to_csv(awd_file_path, csv_file_path):
    """
    Convert a .awd file to a cleaned .csv file for use with CAPy.
    
    This converter does the following:
      - Preserves the first 7 lines of meta data but ensures each of these lines has two fields.
          * For the first 4 lines, if only one field is present, a blank second field is added.
          * For lines 5â€“7, which are to be cleared, a blank row (with two empty fields) is written.
      - For every subsequent line (starting at line 8):
          * Splits the line by whitespace.
          * Parses the first token as the event count.
          * If the event count is negative, the entire line is skipped.
          * Otherwise, if a second token exists, uses it as the light value; if missing, uses 0.
          * Writes the row as two comma-separated values: event_count,light_value.
    
    Parameters:
        awd_file_path (str): Path to the input .awd file.
        csv_file_path (str): Path to the output .csv file.
    
    Returns:
        str: The output CSV file path if conversion is successful.
    
    Raises:
        IOError: If reading or writing the file fails.
